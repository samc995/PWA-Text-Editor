# PWA-Text-Editor

## Description



AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use

- My motivation was to create a text editor that doesn't require internet connection.
- I built this project to test my knowledge of JavaScript and back end databases.
- This project solved me having to take notes on other programs that typically require internet connection.
